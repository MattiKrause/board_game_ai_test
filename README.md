This is a little testing project for working with AI Algorithms.

Currently, the only implemented Algorithms are Monte-Carlo Tree Search Variations.
The only supported games are 7 by 6 and 8 by 8 line four, even though the MCTS implementation 
is generic over provided game, so games like chess and go should be handled ok as well.

The older versions of algorithms are still present, so that they can be compared easily, other ways to achieve obviously exist, but they are more tedious.
